**This project is still in its very early stage of development. There are lots of bugs and missing features :frog:**
  
![](https://i.loli.net/2020/04/12/lTMIFCuUcyeSGjV.gif)  
The goal of this project is to be consistent with the web version [crossnote.app](https://crossnote.app) | [GitHub 0xGG/crossnote](https://github.com/0xGG/crossnote).  
You can read the introduction notebook of the crossnote project directly on [crossnote](https://crossnote.app/?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2F0xGG%2Fwelcome-notebook&branch=master&filePath=README.md) website or on [GitHub 0xGG/welcome-notebook](https://github.com/0xGG/welcome-notebook).  
Right now many key pieces are missing, such as: 

* [ ] Dark theme and ability to customize CSS
* [ ] Crossnote cloud platform integration
  * [ ] Cloud widgets support
  * [ ] Notification system
  * [ ] User settings synchronization
  * [ ] etc..
